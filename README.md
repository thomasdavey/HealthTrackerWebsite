## Health Tracker Web Application

This is a web application that was developed using Python and Django. It was created as part of my software engineering module at UEA where I worked with 2 other students.

Users can input their height, weight and age and are given a recommended daily calorie intake to lose, maintain or gain weight. Exercises are also suggested based on the userâ€™s inputted target weight and finish date. Users can add and save custom food items and exercises.

To run this application:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine - at least version 3.6
2. Make sure you have Django installed on your machine - at least version 3.0.3
3. Clone the repository and run the project in your favourite IDE - we used PyCharm.
